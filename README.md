# kindaSwiftUI

kindaSwiftUI is available for anyone to use, full-featured and all. The only caveat is that if you're using the trial license key kindaSwiftUI will sleep (not execute the desired command) from time to time. To keep it awake 24/7 please add your license key into the KindaSwiftUI-Info.plist file.

Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/rebeloperAlpar/kindaSwiftUI/wiki) for step by step documentation.
